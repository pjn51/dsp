[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

I ran CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb,others.totalwgt_lb),

The output was -0.088672927072602.

To compare this effect size with that on pregnancy length, I also ran CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth).

The output was 0.028879044654449883.
