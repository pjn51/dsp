[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

I ran dist.cdf(maxh)-dist.cdf(minh) to determine what percentage of the distribution is between the min height and the max height, which I set as equal to 177.8 and 185, respectively.

I recieved a result of 0.33, meaning that 33% of the male population is within the height range.
