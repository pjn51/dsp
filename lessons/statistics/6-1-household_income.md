[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

The mean of the sample is $74,279, while the median is $51,227. 

About 66% of the sample makes less than the mean income. 

The skewness is about 4.95, and the Pearson's skewness is 0.74. 

If we were to increase the upper bound from 1 million to ten million, we would expect the skewness to increase further.
